2. **Project Specification**

   - **Frontend Requirements**:
     - Implement a UI using React.
     - Create components for displaying, adding, updating, and deleting todo items.
     - Use TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability.
   - **Backend Requirements**:
     - Set up a Node.js server with Express.
     - Create RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on todo items.
     - Use TypeScript for the backend logic.
   - **Database Requirements**:
     - Choose between MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL (SQL) for storing todo items.
     - Implement data models and database connection logic.
   - **AI Integration**:
     - Use an AI service (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3) to suggest descriptions for new todo items based on the title provided by the user.

3. **Project Tasks and Milestones**

   - **Project Setup and Initial Commit**

     - Set up a GitHub repository.
     - Initialize the project with a README.md file outlining the project scope.
     - Set up Node.js, TypeScript, Express, React, and the chosen database.
     - Create the basic project structure.

   - **Frontend Development**

     - Implement the main UI components (TodoList, TodoItem, AddTodoForm, EditTodoForm).
     - Implement form validation and user-friendly error messages.

   - **Database Integration**

     - Design the database schema.
     - Implement database models and data access logic.
     - Test database operations with sample data.

   - **Backend Development**

     - Set up a NodeJS server and connect to the database.
     - Create RESTful APIs for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for todo items.
     - Implement request validation and error handling.

   - **Testing**

     - Write unit tests and integration tests for both frontend and backend.

   - **AI Integration**

     - Set up an account with an AI service like OpenAI.
     - Implement a service that sends user input to the AI API and retrieves suggested descriptions for todo items.
     - Integrate the AI service with the frontend and backend.

   - **Final Review and Extra Credit**
     - Review the entire project, clean up the codebase, and ensure all features work as expected.
     - Document the project setup and usage instructions in the README.md file.
     - Set up continuous integration using GitHub Actions or another CI service.
     - Deploy the application to a cloud provider (e.g., Heroku, Vercel).
     - Optional: Add more advanced features or optimizations (e.g., offline support, advanced filtering and sorting of todo items).

# Full Stack Todo Application

## Overview

This project is a full-stack Todo application built with React and TypeScript on the frontend, Node.js and Express on the backend, and MongoDB or PostgreSQL for the database. The application also includes AI integration for suggesting todo descriptions.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git
   cd todo-app
   ```
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```env
